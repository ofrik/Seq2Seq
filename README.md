# Seq2Seq
We will implement Seq2Seq algorithm in python like it was implemented in the paper "[Sequence ro Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf)"
instead of using english/french dataset we will use english/hebrew one from [tatoeba project](https://tatoeba.org/eng).
We linked the english sentences with the different translations in hebrew into a single csv file that we will use as our dataset.

## How to use
1) clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/ofrik/Seq2Seq.git`
2) enter the project folder using `cd $project_location`
3) run the model training using `python model_training.py`
